# Variable Mobility Cahn-Hilliard code
- This repository contains C source codes for numerical simulation of Cahn-Hilliard equation incorporating compostion dependent variable mobility. The resulting morphology and the coarsening kinetics are governed by the bulk-diffusion-controlled dynamics and interface-diffusion-controlled dynamics. Provisions for both these situations have been made in the source code. For more details regarding the execution of the code and implementation of the code for two different kinds of dynamics, kindly go through the README file present in the directory.

- The codes available in this repository are developed in collaboration with the Computational Materials Engineering Group, IIT Bombay. The codes are distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (or any later versions). 

- For more details regarding the governing equations for the algorithm implemented, kindly refer to the paper titled: -
